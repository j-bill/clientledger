2. **Create Sample Data**

   - Hide bookmarks bar and extensions
   - Ensure no developer tools are visible

4. **Test Navigation**
   - Navigate through all pages to verify data displays correctly
   - Check that charts render properly
   - Ensure no console errors

### Capture Process

1. **For Each Screenshot:**
   - Navigate to the appropriate page
   - Wait for all content and charts to load completely
   - Scroll to show the relevant section (if needed)
   - Take screenshot using:
     - Built-in screenshot tool (Cmd+Shift+4 on Mac, Snipping Tool on Windows)
     - Browser screenshot extension
     - Full-page screenshot tool (for long pages)

2. **Quality Check:**

## Annotation Guidelines (Optional)

If adding annotations to screenshots:

### Annotation Types
1. **Highlight Box:** Draw attention to specific features
   - Use subtle, semi-transparent boxes
   - Color: Brand color or complementary
   - Border: 2-3px solid

2. **Arrows:** Point to important elements
   - Use curved arrows for better aesthetics
   - Color: Contrasting but not garish
   - Place labels near arrow tips

3. **Text Labels:** Explain features
   - Font: Clean sans-serif
   - Size: Readable but not overwhelming
   - Background: Semi-transparent box behind text
   - Keep text concise (3-5 words max)

4. **Numbers/Callouts:** For multi-step processes
   - Numbered circles
   - Consistent style throughout

### Best Practices
- Use annotations sparingly (not on every screenshot)
- Maintain consistent style across all annotated screenshots
- Ensure annotations don't cover critical UI elements
- Use your brand colors or neutral colors
